# Readme for the Arduino

## Wiring up the button

Button attached to pin 2 from +5V
10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

If the button includes an LED which flashes when the button is pressed then this is connected from pin 13 to ground. You might need a resistor too if the light will draw sufficient current to damage the Arduino you are using

## Wiring the Servo 

Servo attached to +ve, ground and pin 10
